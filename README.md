# 2. Count Pairs whose sum is equal to X
Given two linked list head1 and head2 with distinct elements, determine the count of all distinct pairs from both lists whose sum is equal to the given value x.

Note: A valid pair would be in the form (x, y) where x is from first linked list and y is from second linked list.

Example:
Input:
head1 = 1->2->3->4->5->6
head2 = 11->12->13
x = 15
Output: 3
Explanation: There are total 3 pairs whose sum is 15 : (4,11) , (3,12) and (2,13)
